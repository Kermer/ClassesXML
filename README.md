## Class Documentation Tool
  Goal of this tool/app is to help community in [contributing to Godot's class documentation](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/updating_the_class_reference.html).  
  It is a useful tool for people willing to contribute, who prefer **simple, intuitive GUI** instead of editing xml file with text editor.
  
#### What It Does
  App loads all the classes data along with their properties from ***classes.xml***, allows you to easily and comfortable edit that data, then saves your changes back to the file.
  
#### How To Contribute
  Check: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/updating_the_class_reference.html
